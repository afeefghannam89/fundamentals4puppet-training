## Modules and Classes

In this chapter the basic ressource types are introduced and language constructs like dependencies,
resource defaults, variables and variable types and programmatic constructs. These resource type will
be combined to classes and modules which will be used in the common roles-profiles-pattern.

## Puppet Master

Last but not least we will focus on the Puppet Master. The modules developed will be deployed on it using
git, assigned to nodes and parameterized using hiera. Difference between the Puppet Master and Puppet
Server will be shown before modules provided by the Puppet forge will be used to extend it with the
PuppetDB as reporting backend and Puppet Explorer as graphical interface.
