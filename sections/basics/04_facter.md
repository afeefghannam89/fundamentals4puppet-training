Facter returns key value pairs named facts. In older versions these were simple string representations, newer versions
also structured facts are possible which means a array or hash is returned. 

The facts are used as Puppet's inventory tool and are generated before requesting a catalog from the master. The master
can use facts in conditionals or templates during catalog compilation but it is impossible to change its values during
a run or change the agents behaviour directly on the node based on facts.

Facter includes many different built-in facts and allows to add additional facts in several ways which allows to provide
them by Puppet modules requiring this information.
