# Puppet Resource Command

* Puppet provides a command to directly interact with the Resource Abstraction Layer
* Querying all or one resource of a type returns Puppet code representation of current state
* Setting attributes will change state using available provider

    # puppet resource package vim-enhanced
    package { 'vim-enhanced':
      ensure => 'purged',
    }

    # puppet resource package vim-enhanced ensure=present

Puppet provides a command to directly interact with the Resource Abstraction Layer. `puppet resource` can be
used to query all or one resource of a specified type which will return current state represented as Puppet
code. It furthermore allows to set attributes to a desired state and then Resource Abstraction Layer will
find an available provider to enforce the state.
